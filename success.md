# imitating successful people may be bad

In regards to [this @Scholars\_Stage thread](https://twitter.com/Scholars_Stage/status/1083098047314223104) / [blog post](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html).

So like *metis* develops by imitating successful people? They do something weird, and anyways they're doing quite well for themselves, so why not just do that ourselves, hey? Like this is good because we might pick up on some adaptive hidden variable.

But. What if their success is irrelevant to you? Possibly you might have a better time copying @ElonMusk than @KimJongUn.

However the world is no longer trapped in the 90's; it'd probably be better to imitate someone who's *becoming* a billionaire rather than someone who's been one for Quite Some Time.

(Can somebody give examples? Maybe, uh, fortnite or something idk. That doesn't seem very relevant to most people however.)

If you imitate the wrong people you pick up stuff that doesn't *cause* success. So we know that mattresses and toilets don't cause success, and are actually maladaptive, but they were used by kings.

The king's a fashionable fellow. We'd best get our own mattresses and toilets, 'cuz that's the fashion!

But like toilets weren't a direct transmission from the King, there must've been some Trickle Down action. The king does it, so the court does it, so the bourgeois, etc.

So, it seems likely that Trickle Down Metis is irrelevant.

Perhaps this is an example: Google does all kinds of crazy stuff because they are Internet Scale, and people copy what Google does despite it being overkill for their requirements.

So, conclusions:
1. Fashion creates *metis*.
2. Fashions originating from irrelevant domains should be held in suspicion.
